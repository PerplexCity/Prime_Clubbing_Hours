# Prime Clubbing Hours

Cleaning and organizing the ten data pulls was a shitty, manual process involving reordering lots of columns and looking up opening and closing hours for 48 different gyms. I don't suggest you try it, but if you'd like to, the original data is in the [data folder](https://github.com/PerplexCity/Prime_Clubbing_Hours/tree/master/data) .

Or you could just roll with the finished product, . That's fed into nysc_2.R for analysis and visualizations.
